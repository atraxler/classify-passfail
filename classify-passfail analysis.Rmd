```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Summarize results here.

**Update 6/9:** Started with collecting data information (since I keep forgetting which variables to use). 

```{r packages, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(igraph)
```

## Summary of data

After the network data has been cleaned and assigned node attributes (by `loadAllNetworks.r`), and centrality values are calculated (by `calculatePR_TE_H.r`), the igraph objects are stored in `data/PRTEH.RData`.

```{r}
load("data/PRTEH.RData")
```

That file includes: 

* `accPS`, `accCD`, and `accICS`: Accumulated network objects for each week for the problem solving, concept discussion, and in-class social network layers. 
*
